## Mobile-First Design Improvements

### Responsive Layout Breakpoints

#### Header Section

- **Desktop**: Horizontal layout with auto-width button
- **Breakpoint**: `sm:flex-row` (640px+)

#### Search Section
- **Mobile**: Full-width search input and filter button
- **Desktop**: Max-width constrained search with inline filter button
- **Breakpoint**: `sm:flex-row` (640px+)

#### Table Columns
Intelligent column hiding based on screen size:
- **Contact Column**: Hidden on mobile, shown on medium+ screens (`hidden md:table-cell`)
- **Orders Badge**: Hidden on extra small, shown on small+ screens (`hidden sm:table-cell`)
- **Joined Date**: Hidden until large screens (`hidden lg:table-cell`)
- **Mobile View**: Shows customer name and phone number in stacked layout within name cell

#### Pagination Controls
- **Mobile**: Compact layout with smaller spacing, hidden first/last page buttons
- **Desktop**: Full controls with all navigation buttons
- **Breakpoints**: 
  - First/Last buttons: `hidden sm:flex`
  - Spacing: `space-x-1 sm:space-x-2`
  - Info text: `text-center sm:text-left`

### Touch-Friendly Elements

#### Button Sizes
- **Action Dropdown**: `h-8 w-8 p-0` - 32px minimum touch target
- **Input Fields**: `h-11 text-base` - 44px height for better mobile typing
- **Dialog Buttons**: `h-11 text-base` - Consistent touch-friendly sizing

#### Dialog Widths
- Mobile: `w-[95vw]` - Uses 95% of viewport width with margin for visual comfort
- Desktop: `max-w-[425px]` - Constrained to optimal reading width
- Vertical Scroll: `max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto` - Handles small screens gracefully

## Component Architecture

### New Component: EditCustomerDialog
**Location**: `src/components/pos/EditCustomerDialog.tsx`

**Props**:
```typescript
interface EditCustomerDialogProps {
  customer: Customer | null;
  open: boolean;
  onOpenChange: (open: boolean) => void;
  onCustomerUpdated?: () => void;
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Controlled component with external state management
- Automatic form population when customer changes
- Supabase integration for updates
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Form validation for required fields

### Modified Component: CustomersPage
**Location**: `src/pages/CustomersPage.tsx`

**New State Variables**:
```typescript
const [showEditDialog, setShowEditDialog] = useState(false);
const [deleteDialogOpen, setDeleteDialogOpen] = useState(false);
const [customerToDelete, setCustomerToDelete] = useState<Customer | null>(null);
```

**New Handlers**:
- `handleEditCustomer(customer)` - Opens edit dialog with selected customer
- `handleDeleteClick(customer)` - Opens delete confirmation dialog
- `handleDeleteCustomer()` - Performs actual deletion after confirmation

## User Experience Flow

4. Quick action buttons available: Edit and Delete

### Edit Flow
1. User clicks "Edit" from dropdown or view dialog
