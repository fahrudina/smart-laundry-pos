## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Login Flow**: 
   - Visit `/login` → successful login → redirected to `/home`

2. **Owner Experience**:
   - Login as owner (`owner@example.com`)
   - Use store selector to switch between stores
   - See aggregated data for selected store

3. **Staff Experience**:
   - Login as staff (`staff1@example.com`)
   - Automatically see assigned store data
   - Limited to single store view

4. **Dashboard Functionality**:
   - View real-time metrics
   - Use quick actions to navigate

   - Verify responsive design

## 📊 Database Integration

The dashboard reads from:
- `orders` table: For metrics and recent orders
- `customers` table: For unique customer counts
- `stores` table: For multi-tenant filtering
- `users` table: For role-based access

All queries respect RLS policies ensuring data isolation between stores.

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Loading States**: Skeleton animations during data fetch
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no data
- **Real-time Updates**: Clock updates every minute
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Color Coding**: Status badges with semantic colors
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and transitions
- **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML and ARIA labels

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready home page that serves as the central dashboard for the Smart Laundry POS system.
