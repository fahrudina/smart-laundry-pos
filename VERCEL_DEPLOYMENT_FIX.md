# Vercel Deployment Fix for WhatsApp CORS Issue

## Problem
The application was experiencing CORS errors when deployed to Vercel because it was trying to call the WhatsApp API directly from the browser: `Fetch API cannot load http://34.229.217.97/send-message due to access control checks`

## Solution
Updated the configuration to use Vercel serverless functions as a proxy to avoid CORS issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated WhatsApp Configuration (`src/lib/whatsapp-config.ts`)
- Changed production baseUrl from direct API to Vercel serverless function: `/api/whatsapp-send`
- This ensures all API calls go through the Vercel serverless function instead of directly to the external API

### 2. Updated WhatsApp Client (`src/integrations/whatsapp/client.ts`)
- Added support for Vercel serverless functions
- Updated both `sendMessage` and `testConnection` methods to handle different endpoint types
- No authorization headers are sent to Vercel functions (they handle auth internally)

### 3. Enhanced Vercel Serverless Function (`api/whatsapp-send.js`)
- Added proper fallback values for environment variables
- Added validation for required configuration

## Required Environment Variables in Vercel

Set these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

### Go to: Project Settings → Environment Variables

Add the following variables:

```
WHATSAPP_API_URL=http://34.229.217.97
WHATSAPP_USERNAME=admin
WHATSAPP_PASSWORD=secretPaassword
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add the three variables above

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix WhatsApp CORS issue with Vercel serverless function"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Test**:
   - After deployment, test the WhatsApp functionality
   - Check browser network tab to confirm calls go to `/api/whatsapp-send` instead of `http://34.229.217.97`

## How It Works Now

### Development
- Uses local proxy server (if `VITE_WHATSAPP_USE_PROXY=true`)
- Direct connection to WhatsApp API with CORS handled by Vite proxy

### Production (Vercel)
- Browser → `/api/whatsapp-send` (Vercel serverless function)
- Vercel function → `http://34.229.217.97/api/send-message` (WhatsApp API)
- Response flows back through the same path

## Benefits
1. ✅ No CORS issues (server-side calls don't have CORS restrictions)
2. ✅ Credentials are hidden from browser (environment variables on server)
3. ✅ Same codebase works in development and production
4. ✅ Proper error handling and logging

## Troubleshooting

If you still get errors:

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all three variables are set in Vercel
2. **Check Function Logs**: Go to Vercel dashboard → Functions tab → View logs
3. **Test Function Directly**: Visit `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/whatsapp-send` (should show Method Not Allowed)
4. **Network Tab**: In browser dev tools, confirm calls go to `/api/whatsapp-send`

## Testing WhatsApp Integration

After deployment, you can test by:
1. Going to Settings → WhatsApp Integration
2. Click "Test Connection"
3. Send a test message from the POS system

The requests should now flow through the Vercel serverless function without CORS issues.
